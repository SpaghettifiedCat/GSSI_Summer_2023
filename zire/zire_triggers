===================================Triggers===================================

1) Barra Accesa (Only for debugging)
	fired when CH0&CH1 are ove threshold for one bar for any bar.

2) Cube On
	Cube is read out by 3 SIPM (6x6, 2:1x1 (2 SIPM, one channel) and 2:3x3(one channel)). 3 channels in total. multiple SIPMs for redundancy. A cube is on  when al least 2/3 channels are over threshold.

3) ACS on (Mu vert pass)
	ACS has 2 SIPMs on different channels. Triggered when both channels are over threshold. Valid for any ACS.

4) CALOg On 
	Or for all the cubes.

5) PST On
	At least one bar of the first layer AND at least one bar of the second layer.

6) Vertican Muons
	The central bar of the first 3 layers.

7) MIP pass no FTK
	PST on AND CALOg on AND bottom ACS

8) MIP pass no ACS no FTK
	Exactly the last one but without the bottom ACS.
